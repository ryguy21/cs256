# CS 256 Prototype

## Description
This project is a prototype for a website that would, if implemented, make life
much easier for beginning Japanese students. It includes a video viewer with a
comment feature similar to that sound on SoundCloud.com and a chat feature that
allows the user to send drawings in addition to text chats.
